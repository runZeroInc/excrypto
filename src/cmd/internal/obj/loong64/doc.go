Package loong64 implements an LoongArch64 assembler. Go assembly syntax is different from
GNU LoongArch64 syntax, but we can still follow the general rules to map between them.

# Instructions mnemonics mapping rules

1. Bit widths represented by various instruction suffixes
V (vlong)     = 64 bit
WU (word)     = 32 bit unsigned
W (word)      = 32 bit
H (half word) = 16 bit
HU            = 16 bit unsigned
B (byte)      = 8 bit
BU            = 8 bit unsigned
F (float)     = 32 bit float
D (double)    = 64 bit float

2. Align directive
Go asm supports the PCALIGN directive, which indicates that the next instruction should
be aligned to a specified boundary by padding with NOOP instruction. The alignment value
supported on loong64 must be a power of 2 and in the range of [8, 2048].

Examples:

	PCALIGN	$16
	MOVV	$2, R4	// This instruction is aligned with 16 bytes.
	PCALIGN	$1024
	MOVV	$3, R5	// This instruction is aligned with 1024 bytes.

# On loong64, auto-align loop heads to 16-byte boundaries

Examples:

	TEXT Â·Add(SB),NOSPLIT|NOFRAME,$0

start:

	MOVV	$1, R4	// This instruction is aligned with 16 bytes.
	MOVV	$-1, R5
	BNE	R5, start
	RET

# Register mapping rules

1. All generial-prupose register names are written as Rn.

2. All floating-point register names are written as Fn.

# Argument mapping rules

1. The operands appear in left-to-right assignment order.

Go reverses the arguments of most instructions.

Examples:

	ADDV	R11, R12, R13 <=> add.d R13, R12, R11
	LLV	(R4), R7      <=> ll.d R7, R4
	OR	R5, R6        <=> or R6, R6, R5

Special Cases.
(1) Argument order is the same as in the GNU Loong64 syntax: jump instructions,

Examples:

	BEQ	R0, R4, lable1  <=>  beq R0, R4, lable1
	JMP	lable1          <=>  b lable1

(2) BSTRINSW, BSTRINSV, BSTRPICKW, BSTRPICKV $<msb>, <Rj>, $<lsb>, <Rd>

Examples:

	BSTRPICKW $15, R4, $6, R5  <=>  bstrpick.w r5, r4, 15, 6

2. Expressions for special arguments.

Memory references: a base register and an offset register is written as (Rbase)(Roff).

Examples:

	MOVB (R4)(R5), R6  <=>  ldx.b R6, R4, R5
	MOVV (R4)(R5), R6  <=>  ldx.d R6, R4, R5
	MOVD (R4)(R5), F6  <=>  fldx.d F6, R4, R5
	MOVB R6, (R4)(R5)  <=>  stx.b R6, R5, R5
	MOVV R6, (R4)(R5)  <=>  stx.d R6, R5, R5
	MOVV F6, (R4)(R5)  <=>  fstx.d F6, R5, R5
