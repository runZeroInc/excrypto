The [bytes] package adds several functions that work with iterators:
- [Lines] returns an iterator over the
  newline-terminated lines in the byte slice s.
- [SplitSeq] returns an iterator over
  all substrings of s separated by sep.
- [SplitAfterSeq] returns an iterator
  over substrings of s split after each instance of sep.
- [FieldsSeq] returns an iterator over
  substrings of s split around runs of whitespace characters,
  as defined by unicode.IsSpace.
- [FieldsFuncSeq] returns an iterator
  over substrings of s split around runs of Unicode code points satisfying f(c).
