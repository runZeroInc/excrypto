// ZCrypto is a research and data collection cryptography library, designed to
// be used for measuring and analyzing cryptographic deployments on the
// Internet. It is largely centered around the WebPKI.
//
// ZCrypto contains forks of the Golang X.509 and TLS libraries that speak old
// TLS versions, deprecated ciphers. ZCrypto provides more lenient and open
// access to X.509 certificates and TLS handshake state than its standard
// library counterparts.
//
// ZCrypto also contains a custom X.509 chain builder, designed for bulk chain
// building across large sets of certificates.
